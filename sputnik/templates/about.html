    <h1>About</h1>
  </div>
  <p>I'm a big podcast junkie and this aggregator is built to fill my own needs, which are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Work cross-platform (Linux, Firefox OS, Android, etc).</li>
    <li>Personal feed that clearly displays the latest episodes and marks what has been listened to.</li>
    <li>Requires low resources, i.e. small amount of JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Little cruft and easy to use. No flashy JavaScript animations that would run poorly and load slowly on mobile.</li>
    <li>Easy to leave, with RSS compatible export.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you also love podcasts, please do yourself a service and sign up by clicking <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}">here</a>. It's completely free.</p>
